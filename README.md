# Scaraboard
A keyboard with some Scaramouche art on it!

![Hackboard-case v16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/link-here)



### Inspiration

I wanted to create a keyboard to replace my current keyboard, a (surprisingly decent and fully-sized) membrane keyboard. It has 88 switches, 1 rpi pico, and no LEDs (I don't want the hassle and my current keyboard doesn't have it anyways, thought RGB in a future one would be cool). Also Genshin Impact.

### Challenge

I had only just designed my macropad, and now i had to scale it up. I followed an online guide and consulted my trusty friend who had more experience than I did. I also asked questions in the Hack Club Slack.


### Specifications

BOM:
 - 88x Cherry MX switches
 - 88x 1N4148 diodes
 - 1x Orpheus or Raspbery Pi Pico
 - 88x Blank DSA keycaps
 - 4x M3x16 Bolt
 - 4x M3 Heatset

Others:
 - KMK firmware
 - TopCase.stl (as soon as I sort my files!)
 - Bottomcase.stl (as soon as I sort my files!)
