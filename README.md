### Inspiration

I wanted to create a keyboard to replace my old keyboard that I spilled a smoothie over, a (surprisingly decent and fully-sized) membrane keyboard. Scaraboard has 88 switches, 1 rpi pico, and no LEDs (I don't want the hassle and my current keyboard doesn't have it anyways, though RGB in a future one would be cool). Also Genshin Impact.

### Challenge

I had only just designed my macropad, and now i had to scale it up. I followed an online guide and consulted my trusty friend who had more experience than I did. I also asked questions in the Hack Club Slack.
